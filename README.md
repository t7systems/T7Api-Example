# T7Api Example

## Getting Started

If you have not yet installed Composer, you should do so now:
https://getcomposer.org/

The following section assumes, that Composer is installed globally:

* ```git clone http://git.dirtyherri.de:8000/T7/T7Api-Example.git```
* ```cd T7Api-Example```
* ```composer install```
* ```cd public```
* ```php -S localhost:3333```

Open localhost:3333 in your browser. You should see instructions on how to proceed.

> If you don't see anything, make sure ```display_errors``` is active: ```ini_set( "display_errors", true);```

> Keep in mind to disable 'display_errors' on production environments!
